- `!play <title>` - Adds the specified song to the queue and starts playback if the bot is idle.
- `!queue` - Shows the list of songs currently in the queue.
- `!loop` - Toggles looping of the current song.

!queue          # Displays the current queue
!pause          # Pauses playback
!resume         # Resumes playback
